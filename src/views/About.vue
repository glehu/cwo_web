            Orochi Batsuzoku, or in short Orochi, is a collective that dedicates
            itself to the creation of art in many forms. We also want to put effort into
            making the music and art industry a fair competition without capitalistic exploitation.
            <br><br><i class="bi bi-dot"/>How did it start?
            Originally, some of the current members got to know each other on the
            Trash Gang website chat room.
            On the 2019.08.20 the three founding members Di$, Lich and
            Wiki created their own discord server, migrating all previously known
            people to their newly created home.
            <br><br><i class="bi bi-dot"/>How can I join?
            Just join our
            <a :href="'https://discord.gg/pr2vwr8'">Discord</a>
            server!
            We will discuss everything else afterwards.
            It could not be simpler than that.
